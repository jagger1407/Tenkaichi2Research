Most of these values are float values.
It should be obvious, but by increasing the speed of these moves, the distance 
you travel with these moves also increases. Basically, the higher the speed, 
the higher the reach that move has.

This parameter section is 192 (0xC0) Bytes big.

? = Unknown as of yet

The Structure of data is as follows:

0x0004			= Regular Movement Speed in Water
Size: 4 Bytes each

->	Note: The difference between both of these is that the first
	controls how fast you can ascend/descend while already being
	in a Dragon Dash, whereas the latter controls the 
	Dragon Ascend/Descend move itself.
