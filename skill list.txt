BT2s skill list is in the UTF-16 encoding, meaning each letter is 2 Bytes in size.
Not all Unicode symbols have representations in this game, however.

NOTE: From this point on, when I say the word "char", I am referring to a 2-Byte wide char, wchar_t.

Each line begins with 2 chars denoting the display type.

The first char of this file should be disregarded. It isn't known what it does,
but I suspect that it's just an identifier for a Skill List.
The list officially begins at the 2nd char.

There are multiple categories of entries, each treated differently.
Each line will start with an identifier for these categories, the identifiers are as follows:

'$' = Header
Header with a Dragonball icon.
Used for categories, like Blast 1, Blast 2, Rushing Technique, Combo etc.
as well as Transformations and Fusions.

The 2nd char is the icon ID:
'0' = 1-Star Dragon Ball
'1' = 2-Star Dragon Ball
'2' = 3-Star Dragon Ball
'3' = 4-Star Dragon Ball
'4' = 5-Star Dragon Ball
'5' = 6-Star Dragon Ball
'6' = 7-Star Dragon Ball
'7' = Blue Dragon Ball with an R3 press on the right side,
      used for the Transformation category.
'8' = Blue Dragon Ball with a DPad Down + R3 press on the right side,
      I think this one is unused? It doesn't appear in any Skill List
      while testing.

Note: '9' and other characters will failsafe to a 1-Star Dragon Ball icon.


'%' = Text
This is used for displaying all kinds of text.
Which text in particular is decided by the 2nd char:

'0' = Yellow Star, yellow text, yellow background
      Used for showing Attack Names.
'1' = Blue text, light background
      Used for showing resource costs.
'2' = Red text, light blue background
      Used for showing more info, like Fusion Partner or charge button.
'3' = White text, light background
      Maybe Unused?

Note: Any character that isn't in this list will make the line not display, even if there is text after this.


'#' = Input
This is used for displaying input combinations.
No regular letters are allowed here, only certain chars.

There are some special characters to help displaying a combination:
U+FF08 = '（'
U+FF09 = '）'
U+FF0B = '＋'
U+FF0F = '／'

Then, there's the PS2 inputs.

L1          = "Ｌ１"  = U+FF2C U+FF11
L2          = "Ｌ２"  = U+FF2C U+FF12
L3          = "Ｌ３"  = U+FF2C U+FF13

R1          = "Ｒ１"  = U+FF32 U+FF11
R2          = "Ｒ２"  = U+FF32 U+FF12
R3          = "Ｒ３"  = U+FF32 U+FF13

Left        = "←"   = U+2190
Up          = "↑"   = U+2191
Right       = "→"   = U+2192
Down        = "↓"   = U+2193

Square      = "□"    = U+25A1
Triangle    = "△"   = U+25B3
Circle      = "○"    = U+25CB
Cross       = "×"    = U+00D7

There is one other special character with custom behaviour.
Repeating   = "＊"   = U+FF0A
If this character is used, all next characters will turn into the prior to it for the rest of the line.
e.g. "△＊□□□" is gonna turn into "△△△△△" inside the Skill List.
If this repeating character is used after a square, it will turn into the symbol for square mashing (Used by Violent Rush for example).

'&' = ?
This seems to be followed by 3 numbers. It's used for Transformations and Fusions,
from what I can see, it decides whether it'll be darkened out, in case you haven't unlocked it yet.
How exactly this works is unknown as of yet.


If the line doesn't start with any of these chars, it will be displayed without a special background or icon,
and the text itself will be white.

'@' = Terminator
This char signals the end of the Skill List. If used at any point in the Skill List, everything after it will be ignored.
