# Tenkaichi2Research
These are the results of my research on Tenkaichi 2s AFS files.

In order to find the values I describe here, one must use HiroTex's AFL files on the Tenkaichi 2 AFS files. This will show character .pak files. 
If you have Sparking Studio, you can unpack these .pak files and get a folder, in there are the files for each character.
